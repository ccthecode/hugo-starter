## Project Summary: "Improving Public Health with Better Policies"

This project focuses on raising awareness and advocating for better public health policies through comprehensive surveys and citizen engagement. The project features a series of surveys that assess public opinion on key health issues across the United States, including access to affordable healthcare, mental health services, and regional healthcare needs. The initiative, led by **HealthyGov**, aims to empower individuals to advocate for policies that will improve health outcomes for all, regardless of socioeconomic background.

The project highlights key survey findings, such as broad bipartisan support for healthcare reform, and offers citizens opportunities to participate in shaping health policy through email and cell phone updates. HealthyGov encourages people to stay informed about policy changes and contribute to a collective effort to influence lawmakers. This initiative supports the idea that when enough voices unite, lawmakers will take action.

## Key Components:
- **Health Policy Survey**: A nationwide survey on public health preferences and key issues.
- **Key Findings**: Insights on public support for affordable healthcare, mental health services, and regional healthcare needs.
- **Engagement Opportunities**: Invitations for users to join the movement by submitting their email or phone number for updates and policy news.

This project combines data-driven insights with grassroots activism to push for impactful, widely supported changes in U.S. healthcare policy.
